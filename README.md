Project Title: TastyBites
This project is a PHP-based web application that provides an interactive platform for food lovers to share, discover, and explore recipes. Users can submit their own recipes with ingredients, instructions, and optional images, as well as browse and search recipes shared by others. To make the experience more engaging, the app includes features such as recipe ratings, comments, tagging, and a “favorites” list for saving preferred recipes. The system also allows filtering by meal type, dietary preference, or popularity, making it easier for users to find the right dish. With its mobile-responsive design, TastyBytes ensures that users can comfortably access and enjoy the platform on any device.
